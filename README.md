# Tic Tac Toe (XOX) with a Twist

Introducing an exciting twist to the classic Tic Tac Toe, our XOX game offers not one, but two gameplay options.

First, you can enjoy the timeless charm of the traditional Tic Tac Toe, where the goal is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. However, I have also added an innovative gameplay mode that eliminates the possibility of ties.

In this unique variant, both player X and player O have the option to strategically relocate their previously placed tiles during the game. Once each player has put down all three of their tiles on the board, they can tap on any of their existing tiles to remove it and place it in a new position on the board. This dynamic feature adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement to the game, ensuring that every move counts and making ties a thing of the past. Get ready to experience Tic Tac Toe like never before!
